LaunchFast vs. Traditional Google Sheets: The Ultimate Upgrade

  üî• The Problem with Your Client's Old System

  Your client's current Google Sheets approach is like using a horse and buggy in the age of Tesla.
   Here's what they're stuck with:

  Manual Labor Nightmare üò©

  - Hours of manual data entry for every single product
  - Copy-pasting from multiple tabs across Amazon, Helium 10, Jungle Scout
  - No real-time data - everything is stale the moment it's entered
  - Human error prone - one typo ruins the entire analysis
  - Time-consuming research that takes 30+ minutes per product

  Primitive Technology Stack üìä

  - No API integrations - everything is manual
  - Basic calculations only - simple math formulas
  - No AI analysis - zero competitive intelligence
  - Static data - no live market insights
  - Limited scalability - crashes with large datasets

  Outdated Workflow üêå

  1. Research product manually on Amazon
  2. Check 3-4 different tools for data
  3. Contact suppliers for pricing
  4. Copy-paste everything into sheets
  5. Hope the formulas work correctly
  6. Manually grade each product
  7. Repeat for every single product...
