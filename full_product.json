        "text": "Ive been going on walks again, and my phone's fitness app just wasn't working for me. I didn't want to buy a fitbit again because those are a bit pricey. So i just decided on searching for a smartwatch. I wanted something affordable and something that would come in fast. After a bit of searching I came across this one. It's so convenient, looks expensive, and works so well. It tracks everything and is so easy to use. The app is easy to navigate as well. I bought one for myself and my husband and do not regret it one bit. I've even recommended it to other people. It's a little bulky but after a while you don't really feel it. It can take calls and you can see your messages on there too. It can connect to your music apps so you can control your music if you're exercising or what not. The battery life is pretty good too. I charge it maybe every 2 days or so. Give this one a try. It's great for the price!",

        "text": "It so convenient that this watch has Alexa Built-in for. I’m genuinely impressed with how much value it offers for the price. The HD touchscreen is so vibrant, and easy to navigate even for my poor sighted sister. To me this watch is premium and fits comfortably on my wrist. I love the Bluetooth call functionality I can make and receive calls directly from the watch without reaching for my phone, which is incredibly convenient while driving.This watch is truly smart for all that it offers! I can set reminders, check the weather, or control smart home devices right from my wrist. Fitness tracking is where this watch really shines. With 120+ sport modes. Providing 24/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and SpO2 measurement, helping me stay on top of my health goals.",

        "text": "Watch connects easily, bright screen, customizable in that you can upload your own photo, works well with phone, pedometer function is ok. My previous smart watch was a big, heavy \"military\" style watch that seemed a lot more robust in terms of wear & tear. I suspect the heaviness came solely from the battery, because after a full charge it would last for over a week, sometimes 2, before needing a charge. Unfortunately it suddenly wouldn't charge, I replaced the charge cable but still nothing. Which is why I purchased this one, and after several weeks of use I find the battery life lacking. From 100% to 80% after only a couple of hours, I find myself having to check the charge level a little too often for my liking, noticing also that below 30% it plummets even faster. The silicone strap also feels cheap & flimsy, the strap often popping out of its silicone sleeve that holds the excess & getting caught on things, which is annoying. Other than those 2 things it's a nice, stylish watch, reliable & connects instantly, the app about the same as other smartwatch apps. Worth the sale price (though nowhere near the nearly $200 it claims to have been originally, something I'm dubious of), but the battery life I'm really not too impressed with.",

        "text": "I have an iphone for the first time in my life and decided that I would pair it with an apple watch.  However, I decided to try out this much cheaper compatible smart watch instead.  I am delighted.  I have used it now for 4 days.  I can make and receive phone calls with it.  I can receive text notifications.  It does a great job keeping track of my steps (although it seems to throw off the count of the iphone step tracker so I just pay attention to the step count on the watch).  Asking Alexa questions via the smart watch is hit and miss.  When walking I keep my phone in my pocket and can use the watch to control the music playing through my earbuds.  I can wear it in the shower no problem.  The battery life is excellent.  After 4 days it was down to 30 percent and I decided to recharge it.  It could have easily gone one more day without a recharge.  It is easy to read (even without my glasses).  It fits comfortably.  The watch band can easily be replaced should ever I need to do that.  I can't believe it does so much for so little cost.",

        "text": "I've been wearing this watch alongside the Garmin Instinct for a week, switching which arm I wear each on daily. The ability to answer calls and talk directly through the watch is new to me, and it works great—the other person could hear me clearly, and I had no trouble hearing them. I wear it while swimming, and while it generally works fine, some settings occasionally change. I had the display theme change to a different theme twice, and the DND mode turn on, likely due to the watch face being wet. The touch response can also be tricky when the screen is wet. The step counter on this watch is far less accurate compared to the Garmin, which aligns closely with Google Fit data. I also couldn't connect my blood pressure monitor or Wyze weight scale to the app. I dislike the store requiring purchases for features like watch faces, themes, or memberships. I'm inclined to think the Senbono watch is the one with incorrect readings since the Garmin matches Google Fit. I wish it had a simple tap-to-wake function for the screen, but that feature isn't available. Perhaps my expectations are too high for the price. The photos show the readings from both the Garmin and the Senbono watches.",

The only time I was given option to contact manufacturer was in process of sending it back via Amazon.
